 Safe house plants for Dogs and Cats

Of the 50 plants recommended these plants are listed as safe or nontoxic at the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, ASPCA's Nontoxic Plants List. They also have a poisonous plant list at the ASPCA's Toxic Plants List. Some of the 50 plants are not on either list. If it is not on the toxic list it does not necessarily mean it is safe. I have only listed the plants that were on the nontoxic list.

If you ever do feel your pet may have ingested poison call the Animal Poison control Center (APCC) from the ASPCA for any animal poison-related emergency, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year at (888) 426-4435. A $55 consultation fee may be applied to your credit card.
Or call Kansas State University's (Animal) Poison Control Hotline (785 -523-5679) It is free of charge.
You can also get help at the National Poison Center at (800) 222-1222.
